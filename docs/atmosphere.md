- Middle Latitudes - The middle latitudes are between 23°26'22" North and 66°33'39" North, and between 23°26'22" South and 66°33'39" South latitude. Or The Earth's temperate zones between the tropics and the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions
- Subtropics – The subtropics are geographic and climate zones located roughly between the tropic circle of latitude (the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn) and the 38th parallel in each hemisphere
- Temperate zone -  it lie between the tropics and the polar regions
- Air in motion is wind
