	* Splash screen with logo, without login
	* Landing Page
		* Search Bar to search courses
		* widgets
			* Courses List
			* Ask a question
			* Syllabus
			* Resources
	* Course Module
		* Here I am explaining the design by an example of a particular course say economics
		* once the user clicks on the course, she will land on the first module of a course
		* There will be side bar which will show all the modules - like a table of content, and kind of green dot in front of the module which the user is currently viewing
		* The first module of the course will have a start button at the bottom which we take the user to second module
		* every module in the 1st iteration will be like a page of text, in the end there will be previous and next button
		* In the last module, in the end there will be a button name complete, and it will take the user to another static screen which will show a congratulatory message for 3 second and will take the user back to the home page
