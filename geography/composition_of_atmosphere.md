# Composition of Atmosphere
- Atmosphere is a mixture of different gases and it envelopes the earth all round

- Composition of the atmosphere
	
	- Gases 
		- Carbon dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas as it is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation. It absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth’s surface. It is largely responsible for the greenhouse effect
		- Ozone is another important component of the atmosphere found between 10 and 50 km above the earth’s surface and acts as a filter and absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun and prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth
	
	- Water Vapour
		- Water vapour decreases with altitude. It also absorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and preserves the earth’s radiated heat. It thus, acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot
	
	- Dust Particles
		- Atmosphere has a sufficient capacity to keep small solid particles
		- The higher concentration of dust particles is found in subtropical and temperate regions due to dry winds in comparison to equatorial and Polar Regions.
		- Dust and salt particles act as hygroscopic nuclei around which water vapour condenses to produce clouds.
